## Text Mining Group Assignment:
#Sarah de Jong, Tom Klein Tijssink, Lukas Busch

## Abstract
For our project we want to investigate song lyrics. 
We feel that song lyrics are a really interesting type of text as they contain a lot of abstraction and we are curious to find out how a song could be interpretted by a computer that (most likeley) struggles with this abstraction, but also has no music to interpret a song. 
We have not yet fully decided what we want to do with the lyrics
It could be interesting to do sentiment analysis and see how this changed over the years, or how sentimental diffent music genres are
That said, it would also be really cool if we could write a program that is able to generate (short) songs based on a users' input (For example: Country Song / horses / cars / love )


## Research questions
As somewhat mentioned in the abstract we are thinking about these research questions:
  1) How sentimental are musical genres
  2) Can we create a song writing program that takes a users' input to generate lyrics



## Dataset
For this project we want to use this dataset: https://bigml.com/dashboard/dataset/606f75b49f670413420025a8
The dataset contains 516,165 different song lyrics that can be downloaded in .csv format.
It comes from a websites created for machine learning practices and the data has been properly processed already, making it perfect for our project.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
For the first week we want to get more familiar with the data and have a definitive reserach question
For the second week (also up untill the project update) we hope to have a clear idea of the structure of our code. Preferably a Towardsdatascience / Medium tutorial(s) that we can base parts of of our code on.
By that point, when we are expecting to be familiar with the tasks at hand we plan to distribute the tasks and that will also impact our schedule. When we know more we will update it here
