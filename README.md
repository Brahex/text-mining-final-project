# Text Mining Group Assignment:
### Sarah de Jong, Tom Klein Tijssink, Lukas Busch

## Abstract
For our project we want to investigate song lyrics.
We feel that song lyrics are a very interesting type of text as they contain a lot of abstraction and we are curious to find out how a song could be interpreted by a computer that (most likely) struggles with this abstraction, but also has no music to interpret a song.

We want to build a model that takes a number of words and gives words to follow these words and write a song this way.  We will start by building such a model for a specific genre. Then, we want to perform a sentiment analysis of the different songs and build different models for different genres and sentiments. Another addition could be to implement the model in a way such that the song rhymes.

## Research questions
As somewhat mentioned in the abstract we are thinking about the following research questions
  1) Can we create a song writing program that takes a number of words as well as a genre and sentiment to generate lyrics?

## Dataset
For this project we want to use the dataset 380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics, because this dataset includes lyrics as well as genres. It was originally available on kaggle, but it currently is not anymore. We retrieved the data from a project from last year: https://github.com/ludovicaschaerf/TMCI_Project.
The dataset contains 380,000 different song lyrics that can be downloaded in .csv format.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project
For the next project update, we want to have done (/started) the sentiment analysis (Lukas), building the basic model (Tom), and found a way to test our model (Sarah). We are not sure yet how to test the performance of our model. We could for example give the first few words of a song and see if it generates the next word. However, this may not really be a good measure, because it can still be a proper song without the next word being the word from the original song. Therefore, Sarah will do some research this week on how we could test the performance.

After we have all worked on these 3 tasks, we are meeting on Friday to discuss our next steps.
